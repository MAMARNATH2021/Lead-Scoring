Project Overview
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead and also from past referrals. Once these leads are acquired the sales team makes the calls and send the mails to convert the leads into actual business.

Problem Statement
The problem is the lead conversion % is poor for ex out of 100 leads only 30% got converted. To come out of this situation and improve the conversion % by Identifying the Potential leads also known as "HOT LEADS".

The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted.

Goals of the Case Study
There are quite a few goals for this case study:

1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
2. There are some more problems presented by the company which the model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model as we get in the first step. Also, make sure to include this in the final PPT where in the recommendations.
